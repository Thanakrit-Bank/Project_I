# Geographic Information System tool for Multi-Dimensional Climate Data Analytics

- Target
  Develop a data analysis tool system that supports multi-dimensional data.

- Critical Theory or Hypothesis
  Database tools for manipulating multidimensional data are now available. But the study does not have a tool to help each data set, it is necessary to study the performance of the work, compare between these tools and review them in a form. Functional and soft laser program data are multi-dimensional data such as space and time dimensions. which are all big data Develop tools so that tasks must meet the requirements or data structures required. Changes to the next available disclosure form compared to the user. and summarize the results in style
  The list will therefore inform you that you do not receive information system tools. It offers service software for the access database. and the module data stream

- Project experience
  Develop analytical intelligence tools that support extreme index analysis and let everyone know their battle data.

- Benefits
  Content related to extreme data analysis and analysis of multidimensional data.
